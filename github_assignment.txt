I downloaded the ripley python code from the Texas Tribune. It is only 28 lines long and seems fairly simple. It is named after the alien gut-busting scene from the Alien movies because it is used to find the best restaurants near the Tribune office .

To start with, it seems like one would need both josn and yaml in order to run the program. It also seems important to have a specific .doc using geo locations. These geo locations are punched into the code. Different features seem possible, but I'm not sure exactly what they mean by that. It is supposed to output recommended locations to grab food from the .doc, supposedly also made by Tribune employees. 

I'm not sure how the code is hooked up to the .doc. I also don't understand how the geo location is the best way of finding a good restaurant. There are several lines of code and commands that don't make much sense to me. Overall, this seems like a largely playful program that does very little output for the effort put into it, but there is no problem with a bit of fun.
